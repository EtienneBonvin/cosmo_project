# Data
Data should be placed in the `data` folder. Namely, the following data files must be imported:

- `data/CSD500-r_train-H_total.npy`
- `data/feature_mat_radial_compression.json`
- `data/feature_mat_radial_compression.npy`

Since those files are relatively heavy (several GB), the `data` folder has been added to the `.gitignore`.
